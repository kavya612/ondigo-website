                Oceanic Airlines, and less frequently, Oceanic Airways, is the name of a
                 fictional airline used in several films, television programs, and comic books;
                  typically works that feature plane crashes and other aviation disasters, with which a 
                  real airline would prefer not to be associated.

                The best-known version of an Oceanic Airlines logo, from the ABC television series Lost.
                The brand is used prominently in the TV series Lost, where Oceanic Airlines
                 is featured branded with a highly stylized logo depicting an Australian Aboriginal dot painting 
                 that resembles a nazar, a bullseye, an island, or an "O." The show's fictional storyline begins with 
                 the crash of an airline flight called Oceanic Flight 815.
